## ⚠️ Note on Hover Behavior (Mobile Devices)

CSS `:hover` effects are generally designed for pointer-based devices (like a mouse). On mobile devices, which rely on touch interactions, hover effects may not appear consistently or may not appear at all.

> This is a standard CSS behavior and not a bug in the application.
> For the best experience, use the application on a desktop or large screen device with pointer input.
